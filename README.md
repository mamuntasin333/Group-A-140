Correct Research Question for THIS dataset

“Is there a difference in the mean price between different furnishing statuses?”

## Statistical Analysis

This project investigates whether there is a difference in average house prices between properties located within 10 km of Melbourne CBD and those located beyond 10 km. The analysis uses an independent two-sample t-test to compare the mean prices of the two groups.

A boxplot visualisation is used to illustrate the distribution of house prices in each category. The resulting p-value determines whether the null hypothesis is rejected.
